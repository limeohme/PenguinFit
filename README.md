# PenguinFit

**[Website Home](https://penguinfit-2dec7.web.app/home)**

## Description
***PenguinFit*** is a single-page fitness tracker application that allows registered users to set and edit goals, log activities and meals, and track their progress, visualized through charts. Users can also see and edit their info on their profile page, add other existing users as friends and create joint activities with them.


## Installation
To start the application you can clone the repository on your computer, go to the folder, containing the `package.json` file and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies our project needs to become fully functional (that is, if you already have Node.js installed).

After this, you can run the `npm start` script to start the application in the browser. Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š

***
 There seems to be a problem in the Create React App package and the webpack compiles with warnings. We have researched the problem and decided to not ignore the warnings at this stage.
